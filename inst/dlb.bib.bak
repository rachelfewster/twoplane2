Acoustic monitoring can be an efficient, cheap, non-invasive alternative to physical trapping of individuals.Spatially explicit capturerecapture (SECR) methods have been proposed to estimate calling animal abundanceand density from data collected by a fixed array ofmicrophones.However, thesemethodsmake some assumptionsthat areunlikely tohold inmany situations, and the consequences of violating these are yet to be investigated.
2. We generalize existing acoustic SECRmethodology, enabling these methods to be used in a much wider varietyof situations. We incorporate time-of-arrival (TOA) data collected by the microphone array, increasing theprecision of calling animal density estimates. We use our method to estimate calling male density of the CapePeninsulaMoss Frog Arthroleptella lightfooti.
3. Our method gives rise to an estimator of calling animal density that has negligible bias, and 95% confidenceintervals with appropriate coverage. We show that using TOA information can substantially improve estimateprecision.
4. Our analysis of the A. lightfooti data provides the first statistically rigorous estimate of calling male densityfor an anuran population using amicrophone array. This method fills amethodological gap in themonitoring offrog populations and is applicable to acoustic monitoring of other species that call or vocalize.},

area are capturerecapture (CR) and distance sampling (DS), each with its own largely separate literature. We develop a class of models that
synthesizes them. It accommodates a spectrum of models ranging from nonspatial CR models (with no information on animal locations)
through to DS and mark-recapture distance sampling (MRDS) models, in which animal locations are observed without error. Between
these lie spatially explicit capturerecapture (SECR) models that include only capture locations, and a variety of models with less location
data than are typical of DS surveys but more than are normally used on SECR surveys. In addition to unifying CR and DS models, the
class provides a means of improving inference from SECR models by adding supplementary location data, and a means of incorporating
measurement error into DS and MRDS models. We illustrate their utility by comparing inference on acoustic surveys of gibbons and frogs
using only capture locations, using estimated angles (gibbons) and combinations of received signal strength and time-of-arrival data (frogs),
and on a visual MRDS survey of whales, comparing estimates with exact and estimated distances. Supplementary materials for this article

Several spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models have been developed to estimate animalabundance by analyzing the detections of individuals in a spatial array of traps. Most ofthese models do not use the actual dates and times of detection, even though this informationis readily available when using continuous-time recorders, such as microphones ormotion-activated cameras. Instead most SCR models either partition the period of trap operationinto a set of subjectively chosen discrete intervals and ignore multiple detections of thesame individual within each interval, or they simply use the frequency of detections duringthe period of trap operation and ignore the observed times of detection. Both practices makeinefficient use of potentially important information in the data.Model and data analysisWe developed a hierarchical SCR model to estimate the spatial distribution and abundance of animals detected with continuous-time recorders. Our model includes two kinds of pointprocesses: a spatial process to specify the distribution of latent activity centers of individualswithin the region of sampling and a temporal process to specify temporal patterns in thedetections of individuals. We illustrated this SCR model by analyzing spatial and temporalpatterns evident in the camera-trap detections of tigers living in and around the NagaraholeTiger Reserve in India. We also conducted a simulation study to examine the performanceof our model when analyzing data sets of greater complexity than the tiger data.
Benefits
Our approach provides three important benefits: First, it exploits all of the information inSCR data obtained using continuous-time recorders. Second, it is sufficiently versatile toallow the effects of both space use and behavior of animals to be specified as functions ofcovariates that vary over space and time. Third, it allows both the spatial distribution and abundance of individuals to be estimated, effectively providing a species distribution model, even in cases where spatial covariates of abundance are unknown or unavailable. We illustrated these benefits in the analysis of our data, which allowed us to quantify differencesbetween nocturnal and diurnal activities of tigers and to estimate their spatial distributionand abundance across the study area. Our continuous-time SCR model allows an analyst tospecify many of the ecological processes thought to be involved in the distribution, movement,and behavior of animals detected in a spatial trapping array of continuous-timerecorders. We plan to extend this model to estimate the population dynamics of animalsdetected during multiple years of SCR surveys.},

  abstract = {Reliable estimates of animal density are fundamental to understanding ecological processes and population dynamics. Furthermore, their accuracy is vital to conservation because wildlife authorities rely on estimates to make decisions. However, it is notoriously difficult to accurately estimate density for wide-ranging carnivores that occur at low densities. In recent years, significant progress has been made in density estimation of Asian carnivores, but the methods have not been widely adapted to African carnivores, such as lions (Panthera leo). Although abundance indices for lions may produce poor inferences, they continue to be used to estimate density and inform management and policy. We used sighting data from a 3-month survey and adapted a Bayesian spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) model to estimate spatial lion density in the Maasai Mara National Reserve and surrounding conservancies in Kenya. Our unstructured spatial capture-recapture sampling design incorporated search effort to explicitly estimate detection probability and density on a fine spatial scale, making our approach robust in the context of varying detection probabilities. Overall posterior mean lion density was estimated to be 17.08 (posterior SD 1.310) lions >1 year old/100 km 2, and the sex ratio was estimated at 2.2 females to 1 male. Our modeling framework and narrow posterior SD demonstrate that SECR methods can produce statistically rigorous and precise estimates of population parameters, and we argue that they should be favored over less reliable abundance indices. Furthermore, our approach is flexible enough to incorporate different data types, which enables robust population estimates over relatively short survey periods in a variety of systems. Trend analyses are essential to guide conservationdecisions but are frequently based on surveys of differing reliability. We therefore call for a unified framework to assess lion numbers in key populations to improve management and policy decisions.},
